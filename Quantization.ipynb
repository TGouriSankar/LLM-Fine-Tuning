This lets the model **adapt its weights** to the quantization noise, often recovering **90–99 %** of full-precision accuracy—far better than pure post-training quantization. QAT requires a bit more setup (layer fusion, defining quant-configs, a fine-tuning loop), but it’s still “zero-to-hero” in under 20 lines of PyTorch once your data loader is ready.\n",
